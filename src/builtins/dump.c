/*
 * The dump builtin utility (non-POSIX). Used to dump (or print) the values of variables
 * and symbol table entries (can be extended to dump other things, such as the utility
 * hashtable or the string buffer, for example).
 *
 * Returns 0 if the variables were defined or printed, non-zero otherwise.
 *
 * See the manpage for the list of options and an explanation of what each option does.
 * You can also run: `help dump` or `dump -h` from lsh prompt to see a short
 * explanation on how to use this utility.
