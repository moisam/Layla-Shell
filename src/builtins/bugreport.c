/*
 * This utility is a non-POSIX extension, similar to bashbug in bash. It is used
 * to send bugreports to the shell's author(s), and depends on a properly set and
 * working sendmail program in the system on which lsh is running. The tool is
 * interactive, following a step-wise approach to help the user fill in the bugreport.
 * bash implements bashbug as a shell script that invokes vi. This makes sense, but
 * I think it is better to implement this tool as an integral part of the shell, so
 * that we can collect the information we need reliably (such as the machine type
 * and shell version), without relying on the shell/environment variables which might
 * be changed by the user, filling the report with wrong and unhelpful info (but again,
 * the user can fill whatever they want in the bugreport in all cases).
